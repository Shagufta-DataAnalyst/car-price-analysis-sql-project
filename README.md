# car-price-analysis-sql-project
Create a modern, clean GitHub README banner titled “Car Price Analysis using SQL”. 
This SQL project analyzes a car sales dataset to identify trends, understand pricing behavior, and explore factors that influence car prices such as brand, mileage, engine size, fuel type, condition, and transmission type.



## 📌 Project Objectives
- Understand the structure of the car marketplace
- Clean and prepare data using SQL
- Analyze factors affecting car prices
- Perform EDA using SQL queries
- Generate business insights for better decision-making


## 📁 Dataset Columns
- car_id  
- brand  
- model  
- year  
- engine_size  
- fuel_type  
- transmission  
- mileage  
- condition  
- price
